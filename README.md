# Basics
## 1. VS Code Basics
### Aim
To download and install VS Code and make a hello world program
### Theory
VS Code is a free, open-source code editor developed by Microsoft.We are using it to learn C++.
### Conclusion
downloaded and installed VS Code and performed simple program.
## 2. Data Types in C++
### Aim
To study and implement C++ program structures
### Theory
In C++, data types are used to define the type of data that a variable can hold.Some of them are
int-integer type
char-character type
float-single precision floating type. etc.
### Conclusion
We learnt about different data types in C++
## 3. C++ Operators
### Aim 
To study and implement operators in C++
### Theory
There are many types of operators in C++. some of them are:-
- Arithemetic operators
- Logical operators
- comparison operators
  
Arithemetic operators include addition,subtraction,multiplication,division and modulus.

Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values.

Comparison operators are used to compare two values or variables.They either return true or false based on the result of the comparison.
### Conclusion 
Learnt how to use arithimetic,comparison and logical operators in C++.
## 4. Bitwise Operators
### Aim
To study and implement C++ Bitwise operators
### Theory
Bitwise operators in C++ are used to perform operations on individual bits of integer data types. These operators are crucial for low-level programming, such as system programming, embedded systems, and optimizing certain algorithms.
